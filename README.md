# OpenID Connect Reverse Proxy

A very basic HTTP reverse proxy that forwards HTTP requests to an upstream
server, adding the ID Token as an `Authorization: Bearer` style HTTP header.
It associates the ID Token to a Session Cookie. If the Session Cookie is
absent from incoming requests, an authentication redirect will be sent. This
is especially useful for the [Kubernetes Dashboard][kdb] when the Kubernetes
cluster is [secured via OpenID Connect][k8s-oidc].

This is a toy project! So: Use at your own risk!

## Building

There's a `Makefile` that'll build a statically linked linux amd64 binary
using Docker. But I'm pretty sure that `go build` / `go install` will also
work.
